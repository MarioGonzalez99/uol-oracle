Module: Individual units of the programme are called modules. Each module is a self-contained,
formally structured learning experience with a coherent and explicit set of learning outcomes and
assessment criteria.
Core module: Core modules are central to the teaching and learning on the programme and may
introduce concepts and ideas that appear in the compulsory and optional modules..
Compulsory module: Compulsory modules introduce concepts and ideas that appear in optional
modules. Students must take these modules as part of their studies.
Optional module: Optional modules are designed to extend the concepts and ideas introduced in
core and compulsory modules and to introduce other relevant concepts and techniques. Students
select optional modules from a list.

4 Assessment for the programme
Assessment methods
4.1
An examination is defined as an element of assessment that takes place in a controlled
environment. You will be given details of how the courses on your programme are assessed, the
specific environment or location that is permitted and the time allowed for the assessment. You will
be contacted at least 5 months prior to the assessment session with these details.
All examinations are scheduled using an online delivery method. You must ensure that your device
is kept up to date and complies with University Computer Requirements.
Wherever they are held, all examinations take place on the same dates and at specific times in line
with the published timetables.
4.2
Each module, excluding the Final Project, is summatively assessed either by coursework or a
combination of coursework and a two-hour unseen written examination.
4.3
The pass mark for any element of assessment is 40%.
4.4
The structure of assessment can take one of three types:
Assessment
Structure
Element of
assessment
Element
weighting
To pass the module you must get:
Type I Coursework 50% At least 35% in each element of summative
assessment and a combined weighted average
of at least 40%, subject to the application of
rules for condonement (regulations 4.25 to 4.31)
Timed written
examination
50%
Type II Coursework I 50% At least 35% in each element of summative
assessment and a combined weighted average
of at least 40%, subject to the application of
rules for condonement (regulations 4.25 to 4.31)
Coursework II 50%
Type III Coursework I:
Initial Report
30% At least 35% in each element of summative
assessment and a combined weighted average
of at least 40%, subject to the application of
Coursework II: rules for condonement (regulations 4.25 to 4.31)
Final Report
70%
Refer to Appendix B for the assessment structure for each module.
4.5
If you have a combined weighted average of 40% or above but you have achieved less than 35% in
either element of assessment, your mark will be capped at 39% Fail (which will be subject to the
application of rules for condonement at the point of classification).
4.6
Each coursework element may consist of multiple items of assessment.
Final Project
4.7
The summative assessment for the Final Project consists of both coursework and a written
examination, weighted in the ratio 80:20. The examination will be a two-hour written exam
consisting of questions relating to your project.
4.8
The coursework will consist of multiple items which you should submit according to the prescribed
deadlines set out on the VLE.
4.9
Each item of coursework, totalling 80% of the overall mark for the Final Project, is weighted as
follows:
Summative Assessment Percentage of Overall Module
Project proposal Pass/ Fail
Progress logs 5%
Preliminary Project Report 10%
Project presentation video 5%
Final project report and code 60%
Taking assessments
Refer to the rules on assessment and assessment offences in the General Regulations.
See the website for the list of examination centres.
4.10
Written examinations take place in March and September, at the end of each study session, with
retakes in the next available session.
4.11
When you register for a module, you must take all elements of assessment in the session you have
registered onto. If you do not take the assessment during the session for which you have registered,
you will be required to pay a module continuation fee and take the assessment in a subsequent
session.
4.12
For coursework and project items, you should not exceed the word limits by more than 10%. If the
word count is between 10% to 20% above the word limit, five marks will be deducted. If the word
count exceeds the word limit by more than 20%, you will receive a mark of zero for your work. If you
do not submit your coursework and project items by he submission date you will not be granted an
extension (please also refer to regulation 4.41).
The content within the main body of text comprises the overall word count, including in-text
citations, references, quotes, heading and sub-headings. The cover page, reference list and any
appendices do not count towards the overall word count.
Plagiarism
This section should be read in conjunction with Section 8 of the General Regulations.
4.13
Some items of assessment for this programme will require group work and, in some cases, a joint
submission.
4.14
Where group work is required, and an allegation of plagiarism has been made, the work submitted
will be subject to consideration as set out in the General Regulations and on the website.
4.15
Following an investigation, any penalty imposed may be applied to all members of the group on
behalf of whom the work was submitted.
4.16
All other work submitted for assessment must be entirely your own.
Resitting an element of assessment
If you retake one or more elements of assessment for a module you will have to pay a module
continuation fee when you register for the module to retake the assessment. You may only register
for a retake once your results have been ratified.
When you resit an element of assessment you are also retaking the whole module, you are
therefore strongly advised to fully engage with the learning material to ensure you are fully
prepared for the module assessment.
Assessment is updated in line with general module updates, and so may be different to the original
assessment.
4.17
The maximum number of attempts permitted at any element of assessment is three.
4.18
If your overall result for a module is a fail, you may resit any element of assessment for which you
achieved less than 40%, provided that you do not exceed the maximum number of attempts.
4.19
You will not be permitted to resit any element which you have passed.
4.20
If you retake an element of assessment, your most recent mark will be used for classification.
4.21
If you fail a core module at the third attempt, your registration on the degree will cease. If this is a
core Level 6 module, you may be permitted to transfer to another BSc degree under these
regulations, subject to the rules in Section 6.
4.22
If you fail a compulsory module at the third attempt or an optional module which you cannot or do
not choose to swap, you will no longer be eligible for the degree with honours. You may continue
your studies to obtain a pass degree (unclassified) only.
See Section 7 for the full scheme of award.
Swapping an optional module
4.23
You will be permitted to swap up to two optional modules for an alternative, where possible,
providing you are still within the maximum period of registration. If you do so:
• You must inform us that you wish to withdraw from your current module
• You may commence the new module(s) at the next available opportunity
• You will have the full three attempts to pass the new module(s)
4.24
If you fail an optional module at the third attempt, you may register for an alternative module. Your
mark for the new module will be used for the purposes of classification.
4.25
You will not be permitted to swap any module which you have already passed.
You are permitted to withdraw from a module within 14 days of the module start date, with no
financial penalty. After this point, you will need to pay a new module fee should you decide to swap
for an available alternative.
Marginal condonement
4.26
If you fail a module with a mark of between 35% and 39%, you may be condoned, and have credit
awarded in the same way as for passed modules, providing the mean average mark for the Level is
45% or above.
4.27
We will not permit marginal condonement for core modules or the Final project. They must be
passed in order to be awarded a BSc qualification.
4.28
Condonement may be applied by the Board of Examiners at the point of classification only.
4.29
Where you obtain a mark in the condonable range, you may choose to resit until you become
eligible for the final award, subject to the maximum number of attempts.
4.30
If, at the first attempt, you achieve a condonable fail mark for a module and, in subsequent attempts
to redeem the failure, achieve further condonable fail marks, the highest mark obtained will be used
for the purposes of classification.
4.31
A maximum of 30 credits may be condoned at any given Level.
4.32
The total credit value for which marginal condonement can be permitted may not exceed the
amount specified for the programme as follows:
Qualification Maximum credit value of marginal
condonement
Certificate of Higher Education (Exit
award)
0
Diploma of Higher Education (Exit award) 30
BSc 60 (no more than 30 at any one level)
Deferring an assessment
You will be notified of the deadlines for deferring a module during the study session. To defer, you
must notify us via the defer exams button on the my study page in the student portal. You will be
provided instructions on this process during the study session once examination entry is closed.
If you defer taking a written examination, you have to pay a module continuation fee when you
register for the session in which you wish to take the written examination.
Further information on deferring study can be found in the Additional considerations policy on the
student portal.
4.33
Following the mid-term assessment, you may defer taking the final examination of a module if you
notify us by the deadline. You may only do so once per module.
4.34
You are only allowed to defer written examinations. You will not be permitted to defer a coursework
element. If you miss the deadline for submission, you will be given a mark of zero for the
assessment element and it will count as an attempt.
4.35
If you defer the final examination, but you obtained a mark of 40% or above in the coursework
element, that mark will be carried forward.
4.36
If you defer the final examination, but you obtained a mark below 40% in the coursework, you must
resit that element of assessment. This will be deemed a second attempt.
4.37
If you defer the final examination, you will not be deemed to have made an attempt at that element
of assessment.
4.38
When you resume study of a deferred module, this will count towards the maximum number of
credits you are permitted to study in any one session.
4.39
If you do not notify us of your deferral and do not attend the final examination, you will be given a
mark of zero for that assessment element and it will count as an attempt.
Mitigating Circumstances
Mitigating circumstances are any serious circumstances beyond a student’s control which may
have adversely affected their academic performance. For more information about mitigating
circumstances, see Section 11 of the General Regulations and the Examinations section of our
website.
4.40
You must bring any mitigating circumstances to our attention as soon as you become aware that
your performance may be adversely affected by serious circumstances beyond your control. You
should do this before the deadline date for coursework, project items, and no later than three weeks
after the written examination date.
For details on how to submit notifications and evidence of mitigating circumstances, see the
assessment resources section of the student portal.
4.41
If you have provided evidence of mitigating circumstances you may submit a request for an
alternative session to continue your module studies.
4.42
This will be granted at the discretion of the Board of Examiners and in such cases we will allow you
to defer all outstanding elements of assessment.

BSc
7.1
To be considered for the qualification of a BSc degree with honours you are required to have
passed modules to the value of 360 credits. This may include recognition of prior learning and/or
compensated fails where permitted.
7.2
A BSc will be classified according to the following scale:
Final average Classification
70% or above First Class Honours
60% - 69% Second Class Honours (Upper Division)
50% - 59% Second Class Honours (Lower Division)
40% - 49% Third Class Honours
0 - 39% Fail
7.3
Each module is worth 15 credits and the Final Project is worth 30 credits. To calculate the final
grade for the degree, the marks for the modules are weighted according to credit value.
7.4
The final weighted average will be based on the marks obtained from all modules, including those
eligible for inclusion through the marginal condonement rules.
7.5
When calculating a candidate’s final degree classification, a relative weighting of 1:3:5 will be
applied to modules at Levels 4, 5 and 6 respectively.
7.6
If you have credit for any module through RPL, the examiners will assess your class of Honours
only upon the grades received for the modules you have undertaken with us for this programme.
