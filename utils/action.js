"For the BSc Computer Science programmes, you should note the following
terminology:
Module: Individual units of the programme are called modules. Each module is a self-contained,
formally structured learning experience with a coherent and explicit set of learning outcomes and
assessment criteria.
Core module: Core modules are central to the teaching and learning on the programme and may
introduce concepts and ideas that appear in the compulsory and optional modules..
Compulsory module: Compulsory modules introduce concepts and ideas that appear in optional
modules. Students must take these modules as part of their studies.
Optional module: Optional modules are designed to extend the concepts and ideas introduced in
core and compulsory modules and to introduce other relevant concepts and techniques. Students
select optional modules from a list.

Significant changes made to the Computer Science programme regulations 2024-2025
Programme structure
The following modules have been revised to reflect current practice. Modules have been updated
from the October 2024 session:
• Web Development [CM1040]
• Computational Maths [CM1015]
• Fundamentals of Computer Science [CM1025]
• Introduction to Programming I [CM1005]
• Discrete Maths [CM1020]
Agile software projects [CM2020] will be phased out and will run for the last time in October 2024.
No further registrations will be accepted on this module after October 2024. The last opportunity to
sit the assessment for this module will be October 2026. Module Professional Practice for
Computer Scientists [CM2045] will replace Agile software projects [CM2020] and will run for the
first time in April 2025.
The following modules will be revised to reflect current practice. Modules will be updated from the
April 2025 session:

• Programming with Data [CM2015]
• Databases, Networks and Web [CM2040]
• Graphics Programming [CM2030]
• Final Project [CM3070]
• Introduction to Programming II [CM1010]
Additional modules to be updated in 2025-26, more information will be provided in early 2025.
Computer security [CM2025] will be renamed to Cyber Security [CM2025] from October 2025.
The module will be revised to reflect current practice. All students enrolled on this module will be
required to take the updated module.
Progression
